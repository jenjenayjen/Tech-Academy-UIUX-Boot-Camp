Description of Case study below:

    Theatre Vertigo Case Study

        Overview: 
            The purpose of this project was to apply what I learned at Tech Academy UIUX Designer Boot Camp in real world applications. The goals were to create a wireframe, mockup and a prototype of a website for Theatre Vertigo with what the client requested. 

        Challenges and Goals: 

            The goal was to create a prototype of the website with the requirements from the client. Some challenges I encountered were the implementation of carousels and dropdown menus in the prototype, keeping consistency thought the mockup art boards and keeping the minimalistic look throughout the project. 

            A challenge we faced was to keep arrows or plus/minus signs. A decision was made to keep both as arrows would give the user an intuitive feeling of a page turning left and right and the plus/minus signs would keep a minimalistic look on other pages. 

        Roles and responsibilities: 
            In this project, I created the wireframe, mockup and prototype of a website for Theatre Vertigo. 

        Design Process: 
            The website was designed to be minimalistic; emulated from the client's favored website's homepage. The rest of the pages were designed to not overwhelm the user with too much information in one place so they can focus on the information one part at a time. 

            One page website with a vertical scroll was utilized to give users a viewable section at a time. 

            Side buttons were utilized for call-to-action and fixed so that user would be able to find them at all times. 

            Popups were utilized so that the user would focus on one thing at a time. 

        Solutions and Outcomes: 
            The client requested the donate button as a call-to-action on several sites. While the buttons can be placed anywhere on the page. It was placed as a side button or widget on the right that would be fixed and visible at all times while the user is on the web page.
